# App Engine Queue Configuration
# https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/queue
#
# From docs:
# - All apps have a push queue named default.
# - This queue has a preset rate of 5 tasks per second...
# - bucket_size maximum value is 100.
# - bucket_size default value is 5.
# - max_concurrent_requests (push queues only) sets the maximum number of tasks
#   that can be executed simultaneously from the specified queue.
# - max_concurrent_requests default limit is 1000 tasks per queue.
# - Do not specify a method for push tasks... defaults to POST.
#
# On bucket_size, see http://stackoverflow.com/a/3740846/1093087:
# "Limits the burstiness of the queue's processing, i.e. a higher bucket size allows
# bigger spikes in the queue's execution rate"
#
# Sample Push Queue:
#   - name: optimize-queue
#     rate: 20/s
#     bucket_size: 40
#     max_concurrent_requests: 10
#
